# MineGPT

MineGPT is a GPT-style autoregressive language model built from scratch using PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning. The project covers the complete language model development pipeline, including tokenizer training, dataset preparation, model implementation, custom optimization, training infrastructure, and domain-specific continued pretraining.

The model is pretrained on **1 billion tokens from NVIDIA ClimbMix** and further trained on **Minecraft Wiki** and **Minecraft Question & Answer datasets** to specialize its knowledge in the Minecraft domain.

## Architecture Overview

### Embedding Layer

The model begins with a token embedding layer that converts token IDs into dense vector representations.

The output language modeling head shares weights with the token embedding layer through weight tying.

---

### Attention Layer

Each transformer block contains:

- Linear QKV projection
- Query RMSNorm
- Key RMSNorm
- Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)
- Causal self-attention
- Scaled Dot Product Attention
- Output projection layer

---

### Feed Forward Network

The MLP layer consists of:

```text
Input
  │
  ▼
Linear Up Projection
  │
  ▼
ReLU² Activation
  │
  ▼
Linear Down Projection
  │
  ▼
Output
```

---

### Transformer Block

Each transformer block follows a Pre-Norm design:

```text
Input
 │
 ├── RMSNorm
 ├── Multi-Head Attention
 ├── Residual Connection
 │
 ├── RMSNorm
 ├── ReLU² MLP
 ├── Residual Connection
 │
 ▼
Output
```

Residual branches are scaled by a factor of 1 / √(2L),

where L is the number of transformer layers.

## Training Pipeline

### 1. Train Tokenizer

```bash
python tokenizers_dir/Tokenizer_train.py
```

### 2. Prepare Pretraining Data

```bash
python prepare_pretraining_data.py
```

### 3. Configure Hyperparameters

All model and training hyperparameters are defined through dataclass-based configuration classes inside:

```text
HyperParam_Classes.py
```

### 4. Start Training

```bash
python train.py
```

Training is orchestrated through PyTorch Lightning using dedicated Lightning Modules and Lightning DataModules.
